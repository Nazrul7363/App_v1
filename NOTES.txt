Important Notes
With Android 13, you need to explicty ask for a Post notification permission by the users, this repository does and will not contain code to request perission by the users.

You can use this repo https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-permissions to ask for the permission by the users.

Also you need to mention the permission in android manifest as well

<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS"/>



To Implement Linking u need to Add 
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES" />

in this manifest.xml file
